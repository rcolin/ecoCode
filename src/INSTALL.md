## Howto build the SonarQube ecoCode plugins

### Prerequisites

- Java >= 8
- Mvn 3


### Preliminary steps

The Android plugin uses [CodeNarc](https://codenarc.org/) to scan the gradle files of Android projects. To have more information about CodeNarc: [CodeNarc](/codenarc-converter/CodeNarc/README.md).

CodeNarc must be built separately. Please see the following steps:

Build CodeNarc (Gradle 6.9.2, Java 11), then add this custom-built CodeNarc to Maven dependencies: 

```sh
mvn initialize
```


### Build the code

You can build the project code by running the following command in the `src` directory.
Maven will download the required dependencies.

```sh
mvn clean install
```

Each plugin is generated in its own `src/<plugin>/target` directory, but they are also copied to the `src/lib` directory.



## Howto install SonarQube dev environment

### Prerequisites

You must have built the plugins (see the steps above).


### Start SonarQube

Run the SonarQube + PostgreSQL stack:

```sh 
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Check if the containers are up:

```sh 
docker ps
```

You should see two lines (one for sonarqube and one for postgres).
If there is only postgres, check the logs:

```sh 
docker ps -a
docker logs src_sonar_1
```

If you have this error on run: 
`web_1  | [1]: max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]`
you can allocate more virtual memory:

```sh
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

For Windows:

```cmd
wsl -d docker-desktop
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```


Go to http://localhost:9000 and use these credentials:

```
login: admin
password: admin
```

When you are connected, generate a new token:

`My Account -> Security -> Generate Tokens`

![img.png](images/img.png)
![img_1.png](images/img_1.png)



Start again your services using the token:

```sh
TOKEN=MY_TOKEN docker-compose up --build -d
```

## Howto install Plugin Ecocode

Install dependencies from the root directory:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

.jar files (one per plugin) will be moved in `src/lib` repository after build.
